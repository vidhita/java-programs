1. Uploading program **Gandolf**
  - Gandalf used nothing but a simple letter substitution scheme, and further, that it is its own inverse the same operation scrambles the message as unscrambles it. 
    - This operation is performed by replacing vowels in the sequence 'a' 'i' 'y' 'e' 'o' 'u' with the vowel three advanced, cyclicly, while preserving case (i.e., lower or upper).
    - Similarly, consonants are replaced from the sequence 'b' 'k' 'x' 'z' 'n' 'h' 'd' 'c' 'w' 'g' 'p' 'v' 'j' 'q' 't' 's' 'r' 'l' 'm' 'f' by advancing ten letters.
